# Hello, I'm qdev0! 

I'm a passionate developer who loves developing. Yes, that's all. Developing is what I do. Not just software. I develop food, systems and many more. Developing means creating gadgets. It does not have to be software. If you develop software but can't develop anything else you are not a developer you are a software developer...
