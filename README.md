# Hello, I'm qdev0! 

I'm a passionate developer who loves developing. I love creating things. Like food, software, games or doing  survival sports like climbing, hiking or camping.

My expertise in swe is architecture, streaming(mostly usage of ffmpeg), ci/cd with bash scripting in gh actions and reliable systems(which has 99.9% uptime)

I am currently learning game development.
